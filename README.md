# directorylisting
A php script that creates a file that lists all the directories and sub-directories inside a given/specified folder/directory.

HOW TO USE:

1. Copy the file inside the folder/directory you want to be searched
2. If you want the file to be in a location different from the folder/directory you want to be searched, 
   change the __DIR__ to the full path of the specific name/folder name you want to search(local folders only)
3. you can also change the name/location(line 41) of the output file if you want to
4. run the file via browser or using php command
5. open the generated text file to see the list of all the directories and sub directories 

FUTURE PLANS(for now):
1. expand scale, use ftp/scp connections
2. can list up more information regarding listed directories/subdirectories
